abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. This work explores the stabilization of desired dynamic motion tasks involving hard impacts at non-negligible speed for humanoid robots. To this end, a so-called reference spreading hybrid control law is designed showing promising results in simulation. The simulations are performed employing a dynamical model of an existing humanoid robot and impacts are assumed to be inelastic. The desired motion task consists of having the robot balancing on one foot while repeatedly making and breaking contact with a wall by means of one hand. The simulation results illustrate that the considered controller is suited to control humanoid robot motions with impacts.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. This paper presents a proof of concept to calibrate iCub's skin using vacuum bags. The main idea of the method consists of inserting the skin, made of distributed capacitive sensors, in a vacuum bag and then decreasing the pressure in the bag to create a uniform pressure distribution on the skin surface. The capacitance changes of each sensor were then related to the applied differential pressure using a least square fitting with a fifth order polynomial model. After calibration, integration of the pressure distribution over the skin geometry provides us with the net normal force applied to the skin. Experiments were conducted using the forearm skin of the iCub humanoid robot and the calibration results were validated using standard weights. The validation results indicate acceptable average errors in force prediction.},

The proposed condition ensure both the positive definiteness and the triangular inequality of 3D inertia matrices as opposed to existing techniques in which the triangular inequality constraint is ignored. This paper presents also a new parametrization that naturally ensures that the inertial parameters are fully physical consistency. The proposed parametrization is exploited to reformulate the inertial identification problem as a manifold optimization problem, that ensures that the identified parameters can always be generated by a physical body. The proposed optimization problem has been validated with a set of experiments on the iCub humanoid robot.},

abstract = {Accurate calibration of joint offsets is a crucial requirement for effective kinematic and dynamic control of robots. Such calibration is typically carried out using cumber- some and time-consuming procedures. We propose a technique for joint offset calibration using the measurements from a distributed set of on-board accelerometers. Differently from existing techniques, we do not assume that the accelerometers are perfectly calibrated. The calibration procedure consist in a two steps automatic procedure : the first step calibrates the accelerometer measurements, while the second one computes the optimal joint offsets. The only constraint required for the kinematic chain calibration trajectory is to follow a sequence of static poses or to move under negligible robot acceleration and slow speed. The proposed approach was validated on a position control problem on the iCub humanoid robot.},

abstract = {In the problem of fast bipedal locomotion on uneven terrain, one of the key challenges is in establishing stable footholds. While impedance control on lower limbs can assist in this, it is unclear how the values of stiffness and damping can be chosen. We present an approach for analytically computing the optimal impedances for completing a safe and stable foothold. The robot foot-leg behavior is modeled as a free-floating two- link system making contact with an a-priori unknown surface orientation. The optimal impedance is derived directly from minimizing a cost function based on the center of pressure (CoP) at the instant of making full ground contact. The obtained impedance is shown to be linearly dependent on the orientation of the ground, for a given desired terminal state and CoP position. Consequently the impedance can be estimated based on an expectation of ground orientation at the point of foot contact. The proposed approach is validated in a walking simulation on the full iCub humanoid robot.},

abstract = {Human motion tracking is a powerful tool used in a large range of applications that require human movement analysis. Although it is a well-established technique, its main limitation is the lack of estimation of real-time kinetics information such as forces and torques during the motion capture. In this paper, we present a novel approach for a human soft wearable force tracking for the simultaneous estimation of whole-body forces along with the motion. The early stage of our framework encompasses traditional passive marker based methods, inertial and contact force sensor modalities and harnesses a probabilistic computational technique for estimating dynamic quantities, originally proposed in the domain of humanoid robot control. We present experimental analysis on subjects performing a two degrees-of-freedom bowing task, and we estimate the motion and kinetics quantities. The results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. We discuss the possible use of this technique in the design of a novel soft wearable force tracking device and its potential applications.},

Similarly, we define the state estimation problem as the problem of computing the system positions and velocities. In the present paper we propose a framework for simultaneous state and dynamics estimation. The estimation is framed in a Bayesian framework and a suitable Bayesian prior is defined to guarantee the physical consistency of the obtained estimation. The Bayesian posterior makes use of all available measurements which include encoders, gyroscopes, accelerometers, force and torque sensors. The proposed theoretical framework is validated both on simulation and on the iCub humanoid. The software that implements the theoretical framework is realised with an open-source license.},

@article{nori2015,
abstract = {This paper details the implementation of state-of-the-art whole-body control algorithms on the humanoid robot iCub. We regulate the forces between the robot and its surrounding environment to stabilize a desired posture. We assume that the forces and torques are exerted on rigid contacts. The validity of this assumption is guaranteed by constraining the contact forces and torques, e.g., the contact forces must belong to the associated friction cones. The implementation of this control strategy requires the estimation of both joint torques and external forces acting on the robot. We then detail algorithms to obtain these estimates when using a robot with an iCub-like sensor set, i.e., distributed six-axis force-torque sensors and whole-body tactile sensors. A general theory for identifying the robot inertial parameters is also presented. From an actuation standpoint, we show how to implement a joint-torque control in the case of DC brushless motors. In addition, the coupling mechanism of the iCub torso is investigated. The soundness of the entire control architecture is validated in a real scenario involving the robot iCub balancing and making contact with both arms.},

@inproceedings{traversaro2015inertial,
abstract = {Classically robot force control passes through joint torques measurement or estimation. Within this context, classi- cal torque sensing technologies rely on current sensing on motor windings and on torsion sensing on motor shaft. An alternative approach was recently proposed and combines whole- body distributed 6-axis force/torque (F/T) sensors, gyroscopes, accelerometers and tactile sensors (i.e. artificial skin). A further advantage of this method is that it simultaneously estimates (internal) joint torques and (external) contact forces with no need of joint redesign. As a drawback, the method relies on a model of the robot dynamics, as it consists on reordering the classical recursive Newton-Euler algorithm (RNEA). In this paper we consider the problem of the parametric identification of the robot dynamic model from embedded F/T sensors. We extend recent results on parametric identification by considering an arbitrary reordering of the classical RNEA. The theoretical framework is validated on the iCub humanoid, which is equipped with both 6-axis F/T sensors and joint torque sensors. We estimated the system inertial parameters using only one F/T sensor. We used the obtained parameters to estimate the joint torques and compared the results with direct joint torque measurements, used in this context only as a ground truth.},
