I received the Ph.D. title in Bioengineering and Robotics from the Italian Institute of Technology and the University of Genoa in April 2017. I prepared my Ph.D. thesis [Modelling, Estimation and Identification of Humanoid Robots Dynamics](preprints/traversaro-phd-thesis.pdf) at under the supervision of [Francesco Nori](http://iron76.github.io/).

Since May 2017, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Italian Institute of Technology working in the [Dynamic Interaction Control Lab](https://www.iit.it/research/lines/dynamic-interaction-control).

I am the main developer of the [iDynTree multibody dynamics library](https://github.com/robotology/idyntree)  and a contributor to the [YARP robotics middleware](https://github.com/robotology/yarp) and more in
general to open source software developed at the [iCub Facility](https://www.iit.it/research/lines/icub) collected in the [robotology GitHub organization](https://github.com/robotology/).
