    abstract     = {A crucial part of dynamic motions is the interaction with other objects or the environment. 
                    Floating base robots have yet to perform these motions repeatably and reliably. Force torque 
                    sensors are able to provide the full description of a contact. Despite that, their use beyond a 
                    simple threshold logic is not widespread in floating base robots. Force torque sensors might change 
                    performance when mounted, which is why in situ calibration methods can improve the performance of 
                    robots by ensuring better force torque measurements. The Model-Based in situ calibration method with 
                    temperature compensation has shown promising results in improving FT sensor measurements. There are two 
                    main goals for this paper. The first is to facilitate the use and understanding of the method by providing
                    guidelines that show their usefulness through experimental results. Then the impact of having better FT measurements
                    with no temperature drift are demonstrated by proving that the offset estimated with this method is still useful days
                    and even a month from the time of estimation. The effect of this is showcased by comparing the sensor response with
                    different offsets simultaneously during real robot experiments. Furthermore, quantitative results of the improvement
                    in dynamic behaviors due to the in situ calibration are shown. Finally, we show how using better FT measurements as
                    feedback in low and high level controllers can impact the performance of floating base robots during dynamic motions.
                    Experiments were performed on the floating base robot iCub.}

    abstract={In the literature on robotics and multibody dynamics, the concept of average angular 
              velocity has received considerable attention in recent years. We address the question
              of whether the average angular velocity defines an orientation frame that depends only
              on the current robot configuration and provide a simple algebraic condition to check whether
              this holds. In the language of geometric mechanics, this condition corresponds to requiring
              the flatness of the mechanical connection associated with the robotic system. Here, however,
              we provide both a reinterpretation and a proof of this result accessible to readers with a
              background in rigid body kinematics and multibody dynamics but not necessarily acquainted
              with differential geometry, still providing precise links to the geometric mechanics literature.
              This should help spreading the algebraic condition beyond the scope of geometric mechanics, contributing 
              to a proper utilization and understanding of the concept of average angular velocity.},

    abstract={This video shows the latest results in the whole-body control of humanoid robots achieved by the 
              Dynamic Interaction Control Lab at the Italian Institute of Technology. In particular, the control
              architecture is composed of two nested control loops. The internal loop, which runs at 1 KHz, is in
              charge of stabilizing any desired joint torque. This task is achieved thanks to an off-line identification
              procedure providing us with a reliable model of friction and motor constants. The outer loop, which generates
              desired joint torques at 100 Hz, is a momentum based control algorithm in the context of free-floating systems.
              More precisely, the control objective for the outer loop is the stabilization of the robot's linear and angular
              momentum and the associated zero dynamics. The latter objective can be used to stabilize a desired joint configuration.
              The stability of the control framework is shown to be in the sense of Lyapunov. The contact forces and torques are
              regulated so as to break contacts only at desired configurations. Switching between several contacts is taken into
              account thanks to a finite-state-machine that dictates the constraints acting on the system. The control framework is implemented on the iCub humanoid robot.},

              Such calibration is typically carried out using cumbersome and time-consuming procedures. We propose a technique for 
              joint offset calibration using the measurements from a distributed set of on-board accelerometers. Differently from 
              existing techniques, we do not assume that the accelerometers are perfectly calibrated. The calibration procedure consist
              in a two steps automatic procedure : the first step calibrates the accelerometer measurements, while the second one computes
              the optimal joint offsets. The only constraint required for the kinematic chain calibration trajectory is to follow a sequence
              of static poses or to move under negligible robot acceleration and slow speed. The proposed approach was validated on a position

abstract={In the problem of fast bipedal locomotion on uneven terrain, one of the key challenges is in establishing stable footholds. We present an approach for analytically computing the optimal impedances for completing a safe and stable foothold. The robot foot-leg behavior is modeled as a free-floating two-link system making contact with an uneven surface. The optimal impedance is derived directly from minimizing a cost function based on the Center of Pressure (CoP) at the instant of making full ground contact. The obtained impedance is shown to be linearly dependent on the orientation of the ground, for a given desired terminal state and CoP position. Consequently the impedance can be estimated based on an expectation of ground orientation at the point of foot contact. The proposed approach is validated in a walking simulation on the full iCub humanoid robot.},

                    We regulate the forces between the robot and its surrounding environment to stabilize a desired posture. 
                    We assume that the forces and torques are exerted on rigid contacts. The validity of this assumption is guaranteed 
                    by constraining the contact forces and torques, e.g., the contact forces must belong to the associated friction cones.
                    The implementation of this control strategy requires the estimation of both joint torques and external forces acting on
                    the robot. We then detail algorithms to obtain these estimates when using a robot with an iCub-like sensor set, i.e.,
                    distributed six-axis force-torque sensors and whole-body tactile sensors. A general theory for identifying the robot
                    inertial parameters is also presented. From an actuation standpoint, we show how to implement a joint-torque control
                    in the case of DC brushless motors. In addition, the coupling mechanism of the iCub torso is investigated. The soundness
                    of the entire control architecture is validated in a real scenario involving the robot iCub balancing and making contact with both arms.}
