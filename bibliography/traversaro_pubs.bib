    abstract     = {The article presents a software architecture to optimize the process of prototyping and deploying robot controllers that are synthesized using model-based design methodologies. The architecture is composed of a framework and a pipeline. Therefore, the contribution of the article is twofold. First, we introduce an open-source actor-oriented framework that abstracts the common robotic uses of middlewares, optimizers, and simulators. Using this framework, we then present a pipeline that implements the model-based design methodology. The components of the proposed framework are generic, and they can be interfaced with any tool supporting model-based design. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach describing the application of the resulting synchronous dataflow architecture to the design of a balancing controller for the YARP-based humanoid robot iCub. This example exploits the interfacing with Simulink® and Simulink® Coder™.}

              We propose a nonlinear, second order model in order to capture the model jet engines governing dynamics.

              parameters of the model are found via gray-box identification procedures. Once the model has been identified,
              we approached the control of the model jet engine by designing two control laws. The first one is based on the
              classical Feedback Linearization technique while the second one on the Sliding Mode control. The overall methodology

                    sensors are able to provide the full description of a contact. Despite that, their use beyond a
                    simple threshold logic is not widespread in floating base robots. Force torque sensors might change
                    performance when mounted, which is why in situ calibration methods can improve the performance of

                    main goals for this paper. The first is to facilitate the use and understanding of the method by providing
                    guidelines that show their usefulness through experimental results. Then the impact of having better FT measurements
                    with no temperature drift are demonstrated by proving that the offset estimated with this method is still useful days
                    and even a month from the time of estimation. The effect of this is showcased by comparing the sensor response with
                    different offsets simultaneously during real robot experiments. Furthermore, quantitative results of the improvement
                    in dynamic behaviors due to the in situ calibration are shown. Finally, we show how using better FT measurements as

Localizing the point of contact is useful but determining the force applied on the skin provides many additional possibilities. This additional feature usually requires time-consuming calibration procedures to relate the sensor readings to the applied forces. This letter presents a novel device that enables the calibration of tactile sensor arrays in a fast and simple way. The key idea is to design a plenum chamber where the skin is inserted, and then the calibration of the tactile sensors is achieved by relating the air pressure and the sensor readings. This general concept is tested experimentally to calibrate the skin of the iCub robot. The validation of the calibration device is achieved by placing the masses of known weight on the artificial skin and comparing the applied force against the one estimated by the sensors.}

Distributed tactile sensors are an array of discrete tactile sensors (taxels) with gaps between them. To cope with the gaps, we use interpolation techniques to improve accuracy of the measurements in the skin. Then, we estimate the external force. Finally, we use this information combined with the contact location obtained from the skin to estimate the joint torques. Validation was performed using the iCub humanoid robot. Results show a performance comparable to the joint torque estimation using expensive force-torque sensors. Since the skin is less expensive and does not require modification of the internal structure of the robot, using the skin is an interesting solution.}

  abstract     = {During the last fifty years, the scientific community has dealt with the problem of designing humanoid robots, with the goal of creating artificial machines flexible enough to master any task performed by a human. A prerequisite for such generic machines would be the ability to control the forces that robots exchange with the environment, in addition to their own motion. 
                  These requirements imply that any controller of a humanoid robot requires an implicit or explicit model for the robot’s dynamics, i.e. the laws describing the relation between the robot motion and the forces applied on itself, being either the external forces that the robot exchange with the environment or the forces provided by its own motors. Additionally, any time-variant quantity present in these models need to be perceived by the humanoid robot. If a quantity is not directly measured by a sensor, it needs to be estimated using the available measurements of different quantities and the dynamical models that relate them. Both the dynamics models and
                  the sensor models are typically not perfectly known, and need to be identified from measured data and using a set of a-priori hypothesis. This thesis focuses on addressing the problems of modelling, estimation and identification of humanoid robots, focusing in particular to the specific characteristics and sensor set of the iCub humanoid robot.}

              charge of stabilizing any desired joint torque. This task is achieved thanks to an off-line identification
              procedure providing us with a reliable model of friction and motor constants. The outer loop, which generates

              momentum and the associated zero dynamics. The latter objective can be used to stabilize a desired joint configuration.

abstract={In the problem of fast bipedal locomotion on uneven terrain, one of the key challenges is in establishing stable footholds. We present an approach for analytically computing the optimal impedances for completing a safe and stable foothold. The robot foot-leg behavior is modeled as a free-floating two-link system making contact with an uneven surface. The optimal impedance is derived directly from minimizing a cost function based on the Center of Pressure (CoP) at the instant of making full ground contact. The obtained impedance is shown to be linearly dependent on the orientation of the ground, for a given desired terminal state and CoP position. Consequently the impedance can be estimated based on an expectation of ground orientation at the point of foot contact. The proposed approach is validated in a walking simulation on the full iCub humanoid robot.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a generic framework for test driven development of robotic systems. The framework provides functionalities for developing and running unit tests in a language and middleware independent manner. Tests are developed as independent plug-ins to be loaded and executed by an automated tool. Moreover, a fixture manager prepares the setup (e.g., running robot drivers or simulator) and actively monitors that all the required resources are available before and during the execution of the tests. These functionalities effectively accelerate the development process and cover different levels of robotic system testing. The paper describes the framework and provides realistic examples to show how it has been used to support software development on our robotic platform.},

abstract={This paper proposes techniques to calibrate six-axis force-torque sensors that can be performed in situ, i.e., without removing the sensor from the hosting system. We assume that the force-torque sensor is attached to a rigid body equipped with an accelerometer. Then, the proposed calibration technique uses the measurements of the accelerometer, but requires neither the knowledge of the inertial parameters nor the orientation of the rigid body. The proposed method exploits the geometry induced by the model between the raw measurements of the sensor and the corresponding force-torque. The validation of the approach is performed by calibrating two six-axis force-torque sensors of the iCub humanoid robot.},

abstract={Classically robot force control passes through joint torques measurement or estimation. Within this context, classical torque sensing technologies rely on current sensing on motor windings and on torsion sensing on motor shaft. An alternative approach was recently proposed in [1] and combines whole-body distributed 6-axis force/torque (F/T) sensors, gyroscopes, accelerometers and tactile sensors (i.e. artificial skin). A further advantage of this method is that it simultaneously estimates (internal) joint torques and (external) contact forces with no need of joint redesign. As a drawback, the method relies on a model of the robot dynamics, as it consists on reordering the classical recursive Newton-Euler algorithm (RNEA). In this paper we consider the problem of the parametric identification of the robot dynamic model from embedded F/T sensors. We extend recent results on parametric identification [2] by considering an arbitrary reordering of the classical RNEA. The theoretical framework is validated on the iCub humanoid, which is equipped with both 6-axis F/T sensors and joint torque sensors. We estimated the system inertial parameters using only one F/T sensor. We used the obtained parameters to estimate the joint torques (as proposed in [1]) and compared the results with direct joint torque measurements, used in this context only as a ground truth.},

abstract={Given an articulated rigid body, we define the problem of estimating its dynamics as the problem of computing all the forces and accelerations acting on the bodies which constitute the articulated system. Similarly, we define the state estimation problem as the problem of computing the system positions and velocities. In the present paper we propose a framework for simultaneous state and dynamics estimation. The estimation is framed in a Bayesian framework and a suitable Bayesian prior is defined to guarantee the physical consistency of the obtained estimation. The Bayesian posterior makes use of all available measurements which include encoders, gyroscopes, accelerometers, force and torque sensors. The proposed theoretical framework is validated both on simulation and on the iCub humanoid. The software that implements the theoretical framework is realised with an open-source license.},

                    We regulate the forces between the robot and its surrounding environment to stabilize a desired posture. 
                    We assume that the forces and torques are exerted on rigid contacts. The validity of this assumption is guaranteed 
                    by constraining the contact forces and torques, e.g., the contact forces must belong to the associated friction cones.
                    The implementation of this control strategy requires the estimation of both joint torques and external forces acting on
                    the robot. We then detail algorithms to obtain these estimates when using a robot with an iCub-like sensor set, i.e.,
                    distributed six-axis force-torque sensors and whole-body tactile sensors. A general theory for identifying the robot
                    inertial parameters is also presented. From an actuation standpoint, we show how to implement a joint-torque control
                    in the case of DC brushless motors. In addition, the coupling mechanism of the iCub torso is investigated. The soundness
                    of the entire control architecture is validated in a real scenario involving the robot iCub balancing and making contact with both arms.}

                    At the same time, good models of friction and actuator dynamics are critical for the low-level control of joint torques. 
                    We propose a novel method to identify inertial, friction and motor parameters in a single procedure. The identification exploits 
                    the measurements of the PWM of the DC motors and a 6-axis force/torque sensor mounted inside the kinematic chain. 
                    The partial least-square (PLS) method is used to perform the regression. We identified the inertial, friction and motor parameters
                    of the right arm of the iCub humanoid robot. We verified that the identified model can accurately predict the force/torque sensor
                    measurements and the motor voltages. Moreover, we compared the identified parameters against the CAD parameters, in the prediction
                    of the force/torque sensor measurements. Finally, we showed that the estimated model can effectively detect external contacts, comparing
                    it against a tactile-based contact detection. The presented approach offers some advantages with respect to other state-of-the-art methods,
                    because of its completeness (i.e. it identifies inertial, friction and motor parameters) and simplicity (only one data collection, with no particular requirements).},
