abstract = {This paper presents a set of plugins for the Gazebo simulator that enables the interoperability between a robot,
controlled using the YARP framework, and Gazebo itself. Gazebo is an open-source simulator that can handle different
Dynamic Engines developed by the Open Source Robotics Foundation. Since our plugins conform with the YARP layer used
on the real robot, applications written for our robots, COMAN and iCub, can be run on the simulator with no changes.
Our plugins have two main components: a YARP interface with the same API as the real robot interface, and a Gazebo
plugin which handles simulated joints, encoders, IMUs, force/torque sensors and synchronization. Different modules
and tasks for COMAN and iCub have been developed using Gazebo and our plugins as a testbed before moving to the real robots.},

abstract = {Given an articulated rigid body, we define the problem of estimating its dynamics as the problem of computing all the forces and accelerations acting on the bodies which constitute the articulated system. Similarly, we define the state estimation problem as the problem of computing the system positions and velocities. In the present paper we propose a framework for simultaneous state and dynamics estimation. The estimation is framed in a Bayesian framework and a suitable Bayesian prior is defined to guarantee the physical consistency of the obtained estimation. The Bayesian posterior makes use of all available measurements which include encoders, gyroscopes, accelerometers, force and torque sensors. The proposed theoretical framework is validated both on simulation and on the iCub humanoid. The software that implements the theoretical framework is realised with an open-source license.},

abstract = {This paper details the implementation of state-of-the-art whole-body control algorithms on the humanoid robot iCub. We regulate the forces between the robot and its surrounding environment to stabilize a desired posture. We assume that the forces and torques are exerted on rigid contacts. The validity of this assumption is guaranteed by constraining the contact forces and torques, e.g., the contact forces must belong to the associated friction cones. The implementation of this control strategy requires the estimation of both joint torques and external forces acting on the robot. We then detail algorithms to obtain these estimates when using a robot with an iCub-like sensor set, i.e., distributed six-axis force-torque sensors and whole-body tactile sensors. A general theory for identifying the robot inertial parameters is also presented. From an actuation standpoint, we show how to implement a joint-torque control in the case of DC brushless motors. In addition, the coupling mechanism of the iCub torso is investigated. The soundness of the entire control architecture is validated in a real scenario involving the robot iCub balancing and making contact with both arms.},

@inproceedings{traversaro2015inertial,
abstract = {Classically robot force control passes through joint torques measurement or estimation. Within this context, classi- cal torque sensing technologies rely on current sensing on motor windings and on torsion sensing on motor shaft. An alternative approach was recently proposed and combines whole- body distributed 6-axis force/torque (F/T) sensors, gyroscopes, accelerometers and tactile sensors (i.e. artificial skin). A further advantage of this method is that it simultaneously estimates (internal) joint torques and (external) contact forces with no need of joint redesign. As a drawback, the method relies on a model of the robot dynamics, as it consists on reordering the classical recursive Newton-Euler algorithm (RNEA). In this paper we consider the problem of the parametric identification of the robot dynamic model from embedded F/T sensors. We extend recent results on parametric identification by considering an arbitrary reordering of the classical RNEA. The theoretical framework is validated on the iCub humanoid, which is equipped with both 6-axis F/T sensors and joint torque sensors. We estimated the system inertial parameters using only one F/T sensor. We used the obtained parameters to estimate the joint torques and compared the results with direct joint torque measurements, used in this context only as a ground truth.},

Although it is a well-established technique, its main limitation is the lack of estimation of real-time kinetics information such as forces and torques during the motion capture. In this paper, we present a novel approach for a human soft wearable force tracking for the simultaneous estimation of whole-body forces along with the motion. The early stage of our framework encompasses traditional passive marker based methods, inertial and contact force sensor modalities and harnesses a probabilistic computational technique for estimating dynamic quantities, originally proposed in the domain of humanoid robot control. We present experimental analysis on subjects performing a two degrees-of-freedom bowing task, and we estimate the motion and kinetics quantities. The results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. We discuss the possible use of this technique in the design of a novel soft wearable force tracking device and its potential applications.},

abstract = {In the problem of fast bipedal locomotion on uneven terrain, one of the key challenges is in establishing stable footholds. While impedance control on lower limbs can assist in this, it is unclear how the values of stiffness and damping can be chosen. We present an approach for analytically computing the optimal impedances for completing a safe and stable foothold. The robot foot-leg behavior is modeled as a free-floating two- link system making contact with an a-priori unknown surface orientation. The optimal impedance is derived directly from minimizing a cost function based on the center of pressure (CoP) at the instant of making full ground contact. The obtained impedance is shown to be linearly dependent on the orientation of the ground, for a given desired terminal state and CoP position. Consequently the impedance can be estimated based on an expectation of ground orientation at the point of foot contact. The proposed approach is validated in a walking simulation on the full iCub humanoid robot.},

Such calibration is typically carried out using cumber- some and time-consuming procedures. We propose a technique for joint offset calibration using the measurements from a distributed set of on-board accelerometers. Differently from existing techniques, we do not assume that the accelerometers are perfectly calibrated. The calibration procedure consist in a two steps automatic procedure : the first step calibrates the accelerometer measurements, while the second one computes the optimal joint offsets. The only constraint required for the kinematic chain calibration trajectory is to follow a sequence of static poses or to move under negligible robot acceleration and slow speed.

abstract = {In the literature on robotics and multibody dynamics, the concept of average angular velocity has received considerable attention in recent years. We address the question of whether the average angular velocity defines an orientation framethat depends only on the current robot configuration and provide a simple algebraic condition to check whether this holds. In the language of geometric mechanics, this condition corresponds to requiring the flatness of the mechanical connection associated to the robotic system. Here, however, we provide both a reinterpretation and a proof of this result accessible to readers with a background in rigid body kinematics and multibody dynamics but not necessarily acquainted with differential geometry, still providing precise links to the geometric mechanics literature. This should help spreading the algebraic condition beyond the scope of geometric mechanics,contributing to a proper utilization and understanding of the concept of average angular velocity.},

Distributed tactile sensors are an array of discrete tactile sensors (taxels) with gaps between them. To cope with the gaps, we use interpolation techniques to improve accuracy of the measurements in the skin. Then, we estimate the external force. Finally, we use this information combined with the contact location obtained from the skin to estimate the joint torques. Validation was performed using the iCub humanoid robot. Results show a performance comparable to the joint torque estimation using expensive force-torque sensors.

abstract = {In modern robotic applications, tactile sensor arrays (i.e., artificial skins) are an emergent solution to determine the locations of contacts between a robot and an external agent. Localizing the point of contact is useful but determining the force applied on the skin provides many additional possibilities. This additional feature usually requires time-consuming calibration procedures to relate the sensor readings to the applied forces. This letter presents a novel device that enables the calibration of tactile sensor arrays in a fast and simple way. The key idea is to design a plenum chamber where the skin is inserted, and then the calibration of the tactile sensors is achieved by relating the air pressure and the sensor readings. This general concept is tested experimentally to calibrate the skin of the iCub robot. The validation of the calibration device is achieved by placing the masses of known weight on the artificial skin and comparing the applied force against the one estimated by the sensors.},

@article{chavez2019insitu,
abstract = {A crucial part of dynamic motions is the interaction with other objects or the environment.
Floating base robots have yet to perform these motions repeatably and reliably. Force torque
sensors are able to provide the full description of a contact. Despite that, their use beyond a
simple threshold logic is not widespread in floating base robots. Force torque sensors might change
performance when mounted, which is why in situ calibration methods can improve the performance of
robots by ensuring better force torque measurements. The Model-Based in situ calibration method with
temperature compensation has shown promising results in improving FT sensor measurements. There are two
main goals for this paper. The first is to facilitate the use and understanding of the method by providing
guidelines that show their usefulness through experimental results. Then the impact of having better FT measurements
with no temperature drift are demonstrated by proving that the offset estimated with this method is still useful days
and even a month from the time of estimation. The effect of this is showcased by comparing the sensor response with
different offsets simultaneously during real robot experiments. Furthermore, quantitative results of the improvement
in dynamic behaviors due to the in situ calibration are shown. Finally, we show how using better FT measurements as
feedback in low and high level controllers can impact the performance of floating base robots during dynamic motions.
Experiments were performed on the floating base robot iCub.},

The paper builds upon our former work where a fixed-base formulation had been developed for the human

subject equipped with a wearable motion tracking system and a pair of shoes sensorized with force/torque
sensors while performing different motion tasks, e.g., walking on a treadmill. The results show that joint
torque estimates obtained by using floating-base and fixed-base approaches match satisfactorily, thus validating the present approach.},

Several model classes including rigid body dynamics (RBD) models, data-driven models
and semiparametric models (which are a combination of the previous two classes) are
placed in a common framework. While model classes used in the literature typically
exploit joint velocities and accelerations, which need to be approximated resorting
to numerical differentiation schemes, in this paper a new `derivative-free' framework
is proposed that does not require this preprocessing step. An extensive experimental
study with real data from the right arm of the iCub robot is presented, comparing different
model classes and estimation procedures, showing that the proposed `derivative-free' methods outperform existing methodologies.},

The architecture is composed of a framework and a pipeline. Therefore, the contribution of the article is twofold. First, we introduce an open-source actor-oriented framework that abstracts the common robotic uses of middlewares, optimizers, and simulators. Using this framework, we then present a pipeline that implements the model-based design methodology. The components of the proposed framework are generic, and they can be interfaced with any tool supporting model-based design. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach describing the application of the resulting synchronous dataflow architecture to the design of a balancing controller for the YARP-based humanoid robot iCub. This example exploits the interfacing with Simulink{\textregistered} and Simulink{\textregistered} Coder™.},

@inproceedings{geudelha2019coupledjoints,
abstract = {The estimation of the motor torque and friction parameters are crucial for implementing an efficient low level joint torque control. In a set of coupled joints, the actuators torques are mapped to the output joint torques through a coupling matrix, such that the motor torque and friction parameters appear entangled from the point of view of the joints. As a result, their identification is problematic when using the same methodology as for single joints. This paper proposes an identification method with an improved accuracy with respect to classical closed loop methods on coupled joints. The method stands out through the following key points: it is a direct open loop identification; it addresses separately each motor in the coupling; it accounts for the static friction in the actuation elements. The identified parameters should significantly improve the contribution of the feed-forward terms in the low level control of coupled joints with static friction.},

We propose a nonlinear, second order model in order to capture the model jet engines governing dynamics. The model structure is identified by applying sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics, and then the parameters of the model are found via gray-box identification procedures. Once the model has been identified, we approached the control of the model jet engine by designing two control laws. The first one is based on the classical Feedback Linearization technique while the second one on the Sliding Mode control. The overall methodology has been verified by modeling, identifying and controlling two model jet engines, i.e. P100-RX and P220-RXi developed by JetCat, which provide a maximum thrust of 100 N and 220 N, respectively.},

@article{romualdi2020benchmarking,
abstract = {This paper contributes toward the benchmarking of control architectures for bipedal robot locomotion. It considers architectures that are based on the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) and composed of three main layers: trajectory optimization, simplified model control, and whole-body quadratic programming (QP) control layer. While the first two layers use simplified robot models, the whole-body QP control layer uses a complete robot model to produce either desired positions, velocities, or torques inputs at the joint-level. This paper then compares two implementations of the simplified model control layer, which are tested with position, velocity, and torque control modes for the whole-body QP control layer. In particular, both an instantaneous and a Receding Horizon controller are presented for the simplified model control layer. We show also that one of the proposed architectures allows the humanoid robot iCub to achieve a forward walking velocity of 0.3372[Formula: see text]m/s, which is the highest walking velocity achieved by the iCub robot.},

This paper presents a cost-effective sensorised insole based on a mesh of tactile capacitive sensors.
Each sensor's spatial resolution is about 4 taxels/cm² in order to have an accurate reconstruction of
the contact pressure distribution. As a consequence, the insole provides information such as contact forces
moments, and centre of pressure. To retrieve this information, a calibration technique that fuses measurements
from a vacuum chamber and shoes equipped with force/torque sensors is proposed. The validation analysis shows
that the best performance achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 7N for the contact forces and 2Nm
for the contact moments when using the force/torque shoe data as ground truth. Thus, the insole may be an alternative
to force/torque sensors for certain applications, with a considerably more cost-effective and less invasive hardware.},
