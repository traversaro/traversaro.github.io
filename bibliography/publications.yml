  abstract: A crucial part of dynamic motions is the interaction with other objects
    or the environment. Floating base robots have yet to perform these motions repeatably
    and reliably. Force torque sensors are able to provide the full description of
    a contact. Despite that, their use beyond a simple threshold logic is not widespread
    in floating base robots. Force torque sensors might change performance when mounted,
    which is why in situ calibration methods can improve the performance of robots
    by ensuring better force torque measurements. The Model-Based in situ calibration
    method with temperature compensation has shown promising results in improving
    FT sensor measurements. There are two main goals for this paper. The first is
    to facilitate the use and understanding of the method by providing guidelines
    that show their usefulness through experimental results. Then the impact of having
    better FT measurements with no temperature drift are demonstrated by proving that
    the offset estimated with this method is still useful days and even a month from
    the time of estimation. The effect of this is showcased by comparing the sensor
    response with different offsets simultaneously during real robot experiments.
    Furthermore, quantitative results of the improvement in dynamic behaviors due
    to the in situ calibration are shown. Finally, we show how using better FT measurements
    as feedback in low and high level controllers can impact the performance of floating
    base robots during dynamic motions. Experiments were performed on the floating
    base robot iCub.

  abstract: In the literature on robotics and multibody dynamics, the concept of average
    angular velocity has received considerable attention in recent years. We address
    the question of whether the average angular velocity defines an orientation frame
    that depends only on the current robot configuration and provide a simple algebraic
    condition to check whether this holds. In the language of geometric mechanics,
    this condition corresponds to requiring the flatness of the mechanical connection
    associated with the robotic system. Here, however, we provide both a reinterpretation
    and a proof of this result accessible to readers with a background in rigid body
    kinematics and multibody dynamics but not necessarily acquainted with differential
    geometry, still providing precise links to the geometric mechanics literature.
    This should help spreading the algebraic condition beyond the scope of geometric
    mechanics, contributing to a proper utilization and understanding of the concept
    of average angular velocity.

  abstract: "This video shows the latest results in the whole-body control of humanoid\
    \ robots achieved by the Dynamic Interaction Control Lab at the Italian Institute\
    \ of Technology. In particular, the control architecture is composed of two nested\
    \ control loops. The internal loop, which runs at 1 KHz, is in charge of stabilizing\
    \ any desired joint torque. This task is achieved thanks to an off-line identification\
    \ procedure providing us with a reliable model of friction and motor constants.\
    \ The outer loop, which generates desired joint torques at 100 Hz, is a momentum\
    \ based control algorithm in the context of free-floating systems. More precisely,\
    \ the control objective for the outer loop is the stabilization of the robot\u2019\
    s linear and angular momentum and the associated zero dynamics. The latter objective\
    \ can be used to stabilize a desired joint configuration. The stability of the\
    \ control framework is shown to be in the sense of Lyapunov. The contact forces\
    \ and torques are regulated so as to break contacts only at desired configurations.\
    \ Switching between several contacts is taken into account thanks to a finite-state-machine\
    \ that dictates the constraints acting on the system. The control framework is\
    \ implemented on the iCub humanoid robot."

  abstract: This paper proposes and validates an in situ calibration method to calibrate
    six axis force torque (F/T) sensors once they are mounted on the system. This
    procedure takes advantage of the knowledge of the model of the robot to generate
    the expected wrenches of the sensors during some arbitrary motions. It then uses
    this information to train and validate new calibration matrices, taking into account
    the calibration matrix obtained with a classical Workbench calibration. The proposed
    calibration algorithm is validated on the F/T sensors mounted on the iCub humanoid
    robot legs.

  abstract: 'Accurate calibration of joint offsets is a crucial requirement for effective
    kinematic and dynamic control of robots. Such calibration is typically carried
    out using cumbersome and time-consuming procedures. We propose a technique for
    joint offset calibration using the measurements from a distributed set of on-board
    accelerometers. Differently from existing techniques, we do not assume that the
    accelerometers are perfectly calibrated. The calibration procedure consist in
    a two steps automatic procedure : the first step calibrates the accelerometer
    measurements, while the second one computes the optimal joint offsets. The only
    constraint required for the kinematic chain calibration trajectory is to follow
    a sequence of static poses or to move under negligible robot acceleration and
    slow speed. The proposed approach was validated on a position control problem
    on the iCub humanoid robot.'

  abstract: In the problem of fast bipedal locomotion on uneven terrain, one of the
    key challenges is in establishing stable footholds. We present an approach for
    analytically computing the optimal impedances for completing a safe and stable
    foothold. The robot foot-leg behavior is modeled as a free-floating two-link system
    making contact with an uneven surface. The optimal impedance is derived directly
    from minimizing a cost function based on the Center of Pressure (CoP) at the instant
    of making full ground contact. The obtained impedance is shown to be linearly
    dependent on the orientation of the ground, for a given desired terminal state
    and CoP position. Consequently the impedance can be estimated based on an expectation
    of ground orientation at the point of foot contact. The proposed approach is validated
    in a walking simulation on the full iCub humanoid robot.

  abstract: This paper details the implementation of state-of-the-art whole-body control
    algorithms on the humanoid robot iCub. We regulate the forces between the robot
    and its surrounding environment to stabilize a desired posture. We assume that
    the forces and torques are exerted on rigid contacts. The validity of this assumption
    is guaranteed by constraining the contact forces and torques, e.g., the contact
    forces must belong to the associated friction cones. The implementation of this
    control strategy requires the estimation of both joint torques and external forces
    acting on the robot. We then detail algorithms to obtain these estimates when
    using a robot with an iCub-like sensor set, i.e., distributed six-axis force-torque
    sensors and whole-body tactile sensors. A general theory for identifying the robot
    inertial parameters is also presented. From an actuation standpoint, we show how
    to implement a joint-torque control in the case of DC brushless motors. In addition,
    the coupling mechanism of the iCub torso is investigated. The soundness of the
    entire control architecture is validated in a real scenario involving the robot
    iCub balancing and making contact with both arms.
